      <p> Gun control has been front and center of a national debate since at least the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999. <p>
<p>Many gun-right advocates argue that the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, is an absolute right that resists any legislation that infringes on the right.  They claim that any limitation on the possession of firearms is an unconstitutional assault on liberty and freedom. <p>
<p>In 2022, there have been a total of <a style= "color:black" href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01" target="_blank">49 school shootings.</a> Information on school shootings in the past were mainly reported by traditional media outlets, though social media sites have increasingly become prominent sources of information as they were for the shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. <p>  
<p>Organizations such as <a style= "color:black" href="https://marchforourlives.com" target="_blank">March for our lives.</a> have been created for the promotion of gun control. Their mission reads, “Born out of a tragic school shooting, March For Our Lives is a courageous youth-led movement dedicated to promoting civic engagement, education, and direct action by youth to eliminate the epidemic of gun violence. We aim to create safe and healthy communities and livelihoods where gun violence is obsolete.” <p>

      <p> One response to the tragic shootings has been Red Flag laws present in twenty states.  These laws permit state courts to order the removal of firearms from individuals deemed as unfit to own or have access to firearms. Situations that permit the removal include those deemed to be dangerous or mentally unstable.  The broader application of Red Flag laws, according to gun control advocates, would reduce the frequency of gun-related deaths.  In a similar vein, gun control advocates also support assault weapon bans.  Currently, only eight states and the District of Columbia have laws that restrict the sale and transfer of assault weapons.  These weapons are particularly deadly since they are more likely to result in deaths owing to the high kinetic energy of the fired projectile. <p>

<p>In the Parkland shooting, both a Red Flag law and assault weapon ban could have prevented the shooter from his actions that day. Ilana Soffer, currently a senior at Penn State, was a junior at Stoneman Douglas in 2018 when the shooting occured. Ilana mentioned she and her friends would try to include the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, in their conversations because they were scared of him. <p> 

<p>“In the news they have been portrayed as if they are always being bullied but in my case, personally knowing him, we never excluded him from any conversation,” Ilana said. “We let him talk whenever he wanted to with my friend group in class. We included him because we were scared of him. If something were to happen to your school he would be the person to do that to the school.” <p>

<p>School shootings are both unexpected and common.  For Lisa Soffer, mother of Ilana, February 14, 2018 was like any other day. Lisa was picking up Ilana from school in the car line when she heard rumors of a bomb threat. After trying to call Ilana’s cell phone multiple times and not hearing any answers, her heart sank. That day changed their lives forever. <p>

<p>“It was Valentine's day, a day of love, a day of happiness and since that shooting we don’t celebrate it,” Lisa said. “I used to get cards and little gifts to the kids and now we ignore that day completely. It makes you realize how precious things are and taking things for granted and in a blink of an eye, your whole life can change.” <p>

<p>An important factor in the lethality of school shootings is the type of weapon used.  Of the 338 school shootings documented since the Columbine shooting, 66% involved handguns or shotguns, and 3.8% involved military style assault weapons (the type of weapon used was not documented in 29.5%).  Though military style assault weapons comprise only a small percentage of the shooting, they are highly lethal.  Twenty-three percent of all fatalities involved shooting with these weapons compared with 58% of fatalities from less powerful handguns. <p> 
<p>Ilana has an interesting view on the topic of gun control due to her being in an ROTC program. Ilana mentioned that while she had talked to a lot of veterans who have guns as their way of therapy, she didn’t see a point in civilians being allowed to own rifles. As of 2020, <a style= "color:black" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081" target="_blank">52% of Americans </a> said gun laws should be made more strict but only eight states so far have assault rifle bans put in place. <p>

      <p> There are moments in victims lives where a memory or a news story about a similar event brings it all back. It has been five years since the Parkland shooting but there are moments in Ilana’s life now as a college student where she is reminded of the incident. <p>

“Last year, I was a junior in college, so it had been four years after the shooting happened and I remember sitting in one of my classrooms and I almost panicked because I thought if someone shot into my class right now, how would I react,” Ilana said. “There are moments where you have to take yourself out of that, not go back down that rabbit hole and be back in the present. I think that really helps me stay in the present and not focus too much on what happened.”  <p>
